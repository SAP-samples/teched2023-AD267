# Preparation

Let's start the exercise and see whether everything is ready to go.
Please make sure you have all the necessary prerequisites listed below. If not, please raise your voice during the meeting so that we can assist you early in the session.

## Prerequisites

1. Installation of the ABAP Development Tools (ADT): Go to [this tutorial](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/abap-install-adt.html) and carry out the steps of "Install ABAP Development Tools (ADT)", you don't need to do the "Install abapGit plugin" part.
1. Logon to the SAP Build Lobby https://lcapteched.eu10.build.cloud.sap/lobby using a browser, preferably Google Chrome
1. Your user is provided to you by the hosts of this session
1. Your password is also provided by the host of this session
1. **In almost every chapter of this tutorial there is a reference to a number ###, so a 3-digit number. Make sure that this number was assigned to you by the moderators/speakers of this course. Please remember it well.** It is important as we will use these numbers, where every user has a different one, to create different names for applications and other artifacts. As we will deploy all the artifacts to the same Business Technology Platform account, it is important that they all differ in the names and identifiers, so there are no clashes. 
1. **If you don't have access to the lobby with your username and password or if you don't know your number, please let the speakers know.**
