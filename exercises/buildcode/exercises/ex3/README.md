# Exercise 2: Create service 

Now you will create service entities for Purchase Requisition and S4H Purchase Requisition to define which parts of the data models you just have created should be exposed to the application.

1. Go back to the storyboard page of the application. Find the Services tile and choose the + icon to add a new service entity.
