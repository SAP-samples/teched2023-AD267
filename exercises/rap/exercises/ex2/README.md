# Exercise 2: Create the OnlineShop Application

## Introduction

In this exercise, you will use the package `Z_ONLINESHOP_###` that you created earlier. 
Here, you will create a database table where you will define all the important fields for the OnlineShop application.  

This RAP business object (BO) represents an online shop, where you can order laptops or other articles you need as an employee. <!--After an article such as a laptop is ordered, a purchase requisition can be created by pressing a button in your application which will trigger an action in your RAP BO.-->  

We will start our implementation by building a simple managed RAP business object, and we will add the business logic to call the released RAP API in SAP S/4HANA afterwards.

You will use an ADT wizard to generate all the needed development RAP artefacts of your UI service. This includes the data model, projection view, service definition, and service binding. Afterwards, you will check your _OnlineShop_ application with the SAP Fiori elements preview. 

> **Reminder:**   
> Don't forget to replace all occurrences of the placeholder **`###`** with the 3-digit code in your ABAP username in the exercise steps below.  
> You can use the ADT function **Replace All** (**Ctrl+F**) for the purpose.    


## Exercise 2.1: Create a database table

Create a database table ![table](../../images/adt_tabl.png) to store the _OnlineShop_ data.   
An OnlineShop entity defines general data, such as the product name or the quantity that is ordered. Once the order is checked out, the number of the purchase requisition that will be created using our released API will be stored as well.   

   1. Right-click on your ABAP package **`Z_ONLINESHOP_###`** and select **New** > **Other ABAP Repository Object** from the context menu.
         
   2. Search for **database table**, select it, and click **Next**.
   
   3. Maintain the required information (`###` is your group ID), and then click **Next**.
      - Name: **`ZONLINESHOP_###`**  
      - Description: _**`Persistence for online shop`**_                  

   4. Select your transport request, and click **Finish** to create the database table.
   
   5. Replace the default code with the code snippet provided below and replace all occurrences of the placeholder **`###`** with your group ID using the **Replace All** function (**Ctrl+F**).    
 
      > **Hint**: Hover the code snippet and choose the _Copy raw contents_ icon <img src="../../images/copyrawcontents.png" alt="table" width="30px"> appearing in the upper-right corner to copy it. 
      
<pre lang="ABAP">
@EndUserText.label : 'Persistence for online shop'

@AbapCatalog.tableCategory : #TRANSPARENT

define table zonlineshop_XXX {
  key client            : abap.clnt not null;
  key order_uuid        : sysuuid_x16 not null;
  order_id              : abap.char(10) not null;
  product               : abap.char(40) not null;
  quantity              : abap.int4;
  purchase_requisition  : abap.char(10);
  overall_status        : abap.char(40);

  last_changed_by       : abp_lastchange_user;
  last_changed_at       : abp_lastchange_tstmpl;
  local_last_changed_at : abp_locinst_lastchange_tstmpl;

}
</pre>
       
   6. Save ![save icon](../../images/adt_save.png) and activate ![activate icon](../../images/adt_activate.png) the changes.
   
## Exercise 2.2: Generate the transactional UI service

Create your OData V4 based UI service with the built-in RAP generator.   
The generated business service will be transactional, draft-enabled, and enriched with UI semantics for the generation of the SAP Fiori elements app.

   1. In the **Project Explorer**, right-click your database table ![table](../../images/adt_tabl.png)**`ZONLINESHOP_###`**, and select **Generate ABAP Repository Objects** from the context menu.        
   
   2. From the **Generator** dropdown list, select **`ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model: UI Service`**, and press **Next**.
        
   3. In the **Configure Generator** dialog, maintain the required information to provide the name of your data model and generate it.         

      For that, navigate through the wizard tree (_Business Objects_, _Data Model_, etc...) and maintain the artefact names provided in the table below.
 
      
      > â„¹ **Info about Naming Conventions**     
      > The main aspects of the naming conventions of SAP S/4HANA's Virtual Data Model (VDM) are used in this exercise.

   4. Verify the maintained entries, and press **Next** to confirm.
      
   6. Press **Next** again to move to the Transport Request step.
  
   7. Select a transport request, and press **Finish**. The needed artefacts will be generated.

   8. Go to the **Project Explorer**, select your package ![package](../../images/adt_package.png)**`Z_ONLINESHOP_###`**, refresh it by pressing **F5**, and check all generated ABAP repository objects 
  ![package](../../images/adt_package_with_generated_RAP_artefacts.png)

 
## Exercise 2.3: Preview the OnlineShop App using SAP Fiori elements


In this exercise, you will publish the local service endpoint of your service binding ![service binding](../../images/adt_srvb.png), and start the _SAP Fiori elements App Preview_.

   1. Open your service binding ![service binding](../../images/adt_srvb.png)**`ZUI_ONLINESHOP_O4_###`**, and press **Publish**.

   ![Publish](images/105_publish_service_binding_on_prem.png)
   
   2. Double-click on the **`onlineshop`** entity in the **Entity Set and Association** section to open the _SAP Fiori elements App Preview_.   

   ![Preview](images/107_publish_service_binding_on_prem.png)
   
   3. If prompted, sign in with the user and password provided by the instructors. You should see an SAP Fiori elements application like this:

   ![Fiori elements app](images/109_publish_service_binding_on_prem.png)


      
<!--
## Exercise 2.4: Preview the Online Shop App in SAP S/4HANA on premise


> Publishing the local service endpoint of your service binding **in on premise systems** does not work from within ADT. 
> Therefore you have to publish the Service Binding locally using transaction **/IWFND/V4_ADMIN**.

> Hint:
> The screen shots show the steps for the *Travel* app. Please use the names and strings provided in this script in **step 4 & 5** and do NOT enter the names you see on the screen shots.
